Compatibility with other Mods:
This mod is now compatible with Active IP Block MOD but should be installed
AFTER it.. If you install Active IP Block after this MOD, then you will not 
have Enhanced Logs.

1 - What does this mod do?

This mod replaces /httpd/cgi-bin/logs.cgi/firewalllogs.dat and
provides more advanced filtering.

2 - What is this good for?

In addition with the basic filtering by date, it allows for the
filtering of logs based on the Incoming Interface (eth?) as well
as by Source IP ("the offenders"). Blocked IPs can be shown or hidden.

The Source IPs are colored red if they come from outside (not
from either your local green, orange or purple networks). This
includes your red interface IP (which is local). In other
words, any OUTSIDE IP (the one you care about) will be red. Next
to these "offending" IPs, a number between brackets indicate how
many packets have been dropped. 

Finally, it adds padlock icons next to IPs that are already blocked. 
If the IP was blocked manually or through Active Guardian, the padlock
is red. If an IP was blocked automatically by the Active IP Block MOD, 
the padlock will be orange.

3 - How to install ?

Transfer SW30_Enhanced_FW_Logs-V1.4.1.tgz to /tmp on your smoothwall
and run the commands:

$ cd /tmp
$ tar zxvf SW3_Enhanced_FW_Logs-V1.4.1tgz -C /
$ ./install.sh

4 - How to uninstall ?

Simply run the command:

$ /var/smoothwall/mods/enhanced-fw-logs/uninstall-enhanced-fw-logs-1.4.1.pl

Go to the your Smoothwall Firewall Logs page and enjoy!
